# 3dEngine
[pygame / numpy ] This engine, written from scratch, allows you to create collections of points / lines in 3D space and visualize them using a camera. These entities are combined together in a "scene". Separately, the ability to animate particles to create interesting effects is provided. See working drafts of the project in the "dev" folder.
